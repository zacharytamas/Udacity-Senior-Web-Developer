## Project 1: Meet-Up Event Planner

## Requirements

*You do not need to create a functioning back-end or save user information. Only the form components themselves and their performance will be evaluated.*

1) You do not need to create a real back-end or save user information, but the app must provide a form for users to create an account. Account creation should include, but is not limited to:

* Name
* Email address
* Secure password (with character and length requirements)
* Optional public biographical information (such as employer, job title, birthday, etc)

2) The app should allow users to create a new event. Each event should, at a minimum, allow a user to set:

* Name of the event
* Type of the event (birthday party, conference talk, wedding, etc.)
* Event host (could be an individual’s name or an organization)
* Event start date and time
* Event end date and time
* Guest list
* Location
* Optional message to the guests with additional information about the event

3) The app should display events that have been created.

4) Review the [evaluation rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/5555748649/rubric) for this project early and often.

## Tips, Tricks, and Advice

* You may find that you want to save user information in some way, as opposed to just hard-coding in a few events to meet the “display events” requirement. You could accomplish this by using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) or by using a “back-end as a service” platform like Firebase.
* You can use any framework you’d like - or don’t! It’s up to you.
